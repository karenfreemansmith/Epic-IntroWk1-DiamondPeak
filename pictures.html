    <h3>History of Diamond Peak</h3>
    <p>
      William Macy and John Diamond climbed Diamond Peak in July 1852. These two
      men were part of a preliminary survey party known as the "Road Viewers."
      They climbed the peak in order to plan a road that later became known as
      the Free Emigrant Road. They named the peak for Diamond, who was a pioneer
      from Eugene. The road was completed in late September 1853, only days before
      some 1,027 people with 250 wagons arrived at the Deschutes River at what is
      now Bend. These emigrants, known as the "Lost Wagon Train of 1853," were
      following Elijah Elliott through the central Oregon high desert on what
      became known as the Elliott Cutoff. It took time to locate the road because
      it was 30 miles (48 km) upstream on the Deschutes. The road led them to
      Emigrant Pass by Summit Lake and then down the western side of the pass.
      In mid-October the emigrants were discovered on the Middle Fork Willamette
      River by the settlers of the upper Willamette Valley and a large rescue
      operation was launched to help the emigrants reach the settlements. This
      emigration doubled the population of Lane County.
